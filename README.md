## What is Linux?
Just like Windows, iOS, and Mac OS, Linux is an operating system. In fact, one of the most popular platforms on the planet, Android, is powered by the Linux operating system. An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop.To put it simply, the operating system manages the communication between your software and your hardware. Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldn?t function.
**Linux is also distributed under an open source license. Open source follows these key tenants:**
 The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.
 The freedom to study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish.
 The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
 The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others.
Linux has a number of different versions to suit any type of user. From new users to hard-core users, you’ll find a “flavor” of Linux to match your needs. These versions are called distributions (or, in the short form, “distros”). Nearly every distribution of Linux can be downloaded for free, burned onto disk (or USB thumb drive), and installed (on as many machines as you like).
**Popular Linux distributions include:**
1. Linux Mint
2. Debian
3. Ubuntu
4. Antergos
5. Solus
